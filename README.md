# Image-Based-Obstacle-Detection-for-Autonomous-Vehicles-Using-CNNs
Welcome to the repository for the Introduction to Digital Engineering (ENGO 680) Project, where I collaborated with my group members to explore obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles using image-based techniques.

This project focuses on implementing a monocular vision-based approach for real-time obstacle detection in autonomous vehicles. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Tensor Flow, the solution is designed to process input from a single camera to detect and classify obstacles efficiently.


# Key Features
Dataset: Utilizes the German traffic sign recognition benchmark dataset, video of random streets in Prague, and YOLO model from Ultralytics for compatibility with our object detection model.

Model Training: Includes annotated data preparation using CVAT, Pre-training with the YOLO model, and evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, false positives/negatives, and depth estimation.

Real-World Testing: Simulates real-world conditions by processing recorded video footage of streets.

Focus Areas: Emphasis on computational speed, anomaly detection, and robust detection in diverse driving environments.
